<!-- Insert centered image prior to text. -->
<center><img src="science communication.jpg" height="200" width="400"></center>

<!-- class "intro" for the description of "About Me" to set appropriate margins as noted in the spenceandresume.css. -->
<p class="intro">As an intellectual property ("IP") attorney for more than six years, I have gained experience in litigation, commercial transactions, enforcement and prosecution. My passion for IP is driven by the fact that I am a technology enthusiast. From the life sciences to software design, I have always been interested in cutting edge technology, scientific innovation, and I strongly believe that technology, business methods, and innovation are excellent mechanisms for social change and making a difference. It is that passion which has led me to take a Front End Web Development course at General Assembly.</p>

<p class="intro">During my spare time, I love baking (especially cupcakes), reading, traveling (especially to my native country of Jamaica)! I am also a foodie who loves to explore new restaurants, as well as explore the <strong>amazing borough of Queens!</strong></p>
