			<p>As proud Queensites, we have always felt that Queens is the hidden jewel of New York City. Recently, the Lonely Planet chose Queens as the best place to visit in 2015. So, move over Brooklyn, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island, Queens has arrived and the secret is out!</p>

				<p>Jamaican Brooklyn-born Queensite from Laurelton! As an attorney by day and foodie by night, Nicki fell in love with Queens when she moved to Laurelton with her family at the age of three. From the lofty city apartments and Greek bakeries of Astoria, densely populated surburbs and Brazilian Churrascaria of Corona to the manicured lawns and Halal Chinese restaurants of Queens Village, Queens represents a true blend of cultures, food, topography and religions. Where else can you find a Hindu temple, Greek Orthodox church, Jewish synagogue, Muslim mosque and Baptist church within a two block radius? </p>

				<p>Faith, Family and Food! Timothy is a Queens-born and raised foodie. He enjoys BBQ in his backyard surrounded by friends and family. He loves the trees, parks and wide open spaces that are indicative of Queens, where block parties, driveways and quiet summer evenings are common. When the rest of the NYC is boasting, Queens is one of the last places where you can relax and slow down, even if it’s just on the weekends. As an amateur chef, Timothy loves the fresh food markets and varieties of spices and foods that are available in one of Queens’ many markets and local neighborhood stores. From Latin bakeries to Asian delicacies, Timothy loves them all and eats them all. </p>
