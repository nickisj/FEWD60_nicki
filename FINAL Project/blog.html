			<h2>5 Burros Cafe (Forest Hills, Queens)</h2>
			<a href="http://www.5burrocafe.com/" class="website">Website</a>
			
			<p>Chimichangas, Voted the Best Margaritas in NYC, and fast service! Seriously, need I say anymore.</p>
			<p>This small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant and bar serves amazing Tex-Mex food at a fair price. We have eaten (and drank) here for years and we have yet to have a bad meal. The bartenders and servers are friendly and its plethora of license plates and memorabilia from the Baja California Peninsula are the perfect decor.</p>
			<p>CAUTION: Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes around dinner time and if you are claustrophobic, ask for a table in the back. You may have a longer wait, but its worth it! Remember bring your big pants and not soo fitted dress...portions are nice and hearty so dig in.</p>

			<h2>Fourth Annual Jamaican Jerk Festival</h2>
			<a href="http://jerkfestivalny.com/" class="website">Website</a>

			<p>Date: Sunday, July 19th, 2015</p>
			<p>Location: Roy Wilkins Park, 177-01 Baisley Blvd, Jamaica, New York</p>

			<p>Live pulsating Carribean music, tantalizing Caribbean crafts and wares, finger licking jerk foods of all types - from jerk ice cream to the most traditional jerk chicken and pork. This event is a feast for the eyes, ears, tongue and belly. This year's festival included a cook-off competition with notably the current Ms. Jamaica - Universe, and NYC mayor Bill DeBlasio. In light of recent decrease in speed limits in the Southern Queens community, and the increase in traffic violations, Mr. DeBlasio's reception was not as warm as the sweltering 90+ degrees on that day.</p>

			<p> What is jerk?</p>
			<p>Jerk is a style of cooking or seasoning that is native to Jamaica, which is a blend of local spices to add a distractive taste to foods. In meats or poultry, the jerk seasoning can be applied as a dry-rub or wet marinated mixture. The secret is the intensity of the seasoning (spicy or mild), indregients, and cooking techniques. The last two secrets most Jamaican chef keep very close to chest and are traditionally exclusively passed down within the family.</p>

			<p>CAUTION: This year was hot to the point of being unbearable at times, So, I strongly suggest that you arrive early and bring a chair and plenty of water because shaded areas are very limited. Otherwise, attend later in the day, when it is cooler. You will, however, take the chance that most of the popular jerk dishes will be sold out. Additionally, there is no published listing on the order of the performances for the musical artists. Therefore, unless you are only attending for the more popular artists or headliners who generally perform near the end of the evening, be prepared to come early and wait.</p>
