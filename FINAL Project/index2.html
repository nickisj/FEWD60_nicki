I love that picked a topic that you are enthusiastic about! It really shows in your final execution. You've hit all the key points and show a solid grasp of the course objectives. 

I encourage you to continue tweaking some of the design components on the site. For example, you might consider adding captions to the carousel, so I that I know where all of these amazing places are in queens! 

I don't love the larger text size that's happening when I hover over links. I'd like you to look for a design that's a little more subtle. 

I also encourate you to think about the information design. I'd look for an alternative way to share subway information and remove the image behind the form. The form is steill useful, but you might consider having a photo that speaks to being friendly (something that makes me want to reach out to you! like a photo!).

There are also some small adjustments that you can make to the responsive design to clean up the layout. The different elements all line up differently, which is visually awkward.
